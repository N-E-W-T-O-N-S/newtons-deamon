# N.E.W.T.O.N.S Deamon

The N.E.W.T.O.N.S deamon is the core of the engine.
In here runs everything from physics calculations to collision resolutions and is 100% C#.
This does NOT include any graphical interface and can therefore only be used as a libarary.
N.E.W.T.O.N.S does however have a demo api for Unity to use with the enigine prebuild in it as a dll.
To try it, check out the other repos. More apis are planed for the future.
